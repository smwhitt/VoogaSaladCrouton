    * xstream, creating and reading XML file 


* Responsibilities include not only Serializing, but calling the gameEngine functionality on behalf of the frontend. 

* We will be creating the objects the the author wants to create, and also write them to XML. We will also create a function to read those objects from XML, for the gameEngine to run game. 

* Nishant will also be creating the initial properties files (likely empty) for front end and backend to fill out

    * Engine API
* Lakshya (1st Sprint)
