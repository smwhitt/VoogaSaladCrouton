# Team Contract

1. If you are busy and unable to contribute something when needed, let everyone know so that we can plan ahead.
2. Use GitLabs Issues features to track bugs you know exist, as well as what you are working on so we don't have
multiple people working or worrying about the same feature.
3. Attend all team meetings, and if not possible notify the team.
