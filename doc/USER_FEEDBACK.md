* User 1 Feedback
    * Tried clicking on tiles to make map, figured out dragging but wants instructions
    * Drag sometimes has some errors, always needs to go slow, directionality is odd (something illegal creates no issues)
    * No idea about spawn point
    * Goes to level editors, tried to add a map to the level editor
    * Added wave, uncertain about frequency, saved it
    * Level editor
    * Added waves, can keep adding waves to the level, can’t select map
    * Clarity about save button needed (between edit and save)
    * Tried to click add new image instead of clicking default provided images
    * Numbers could use units or something
* User 2 Feedback
    * Units or default values
    * Instructions for how to edit
    * Start with default pics as big
    * Exceptions in authoring
* User 3 Feedback
    * Include units for frequency, for wave creation 
    * Could not save enemy editor, or it did not show 
    * Saving a wave sometimes allows for the wave to be saved twice 
    * Save button adds a new wave, 
    * Everything is easy to find, and the descriptions are cool 
* User 4 Feedback 
    * Clicked on the create game easily 
    * Clicked on the wave tab 
    * For the wave, a check mark for whether you’ve saved it 
    * Units for spawn frequency (is it per seconds)
    * Was able to go to the projectile editor, speed was not specified units, range is confusing for damage, what makes it had 
* user 5
    * Tried to add another image 
    * Put in 4,10,and then 50 
    * Saveda projectile, and then the image shown 
* user 5
    * Difficult to figure out how to make paths (need instructions for click and drag)
    * Instructions for shift click for spawn points and tower
    * UNITS (what is projectile health)
    * Make Frequency Upgrade more clear
    * Easy to associate projectile
    * Clearer about units
    * Good progression of editor tabs
* User 6 Feedback
    * Upgrade -- add help page
    * Path -- need start point and endpoint
    * Branching paths?
    * Instructions on how to make a map
* User 7 Feedback
    * Making a map
    * User quickly figured out you drag it to make a map
    * Error checking for continuous path
    * Issue: hard to drag for edge of screen
    * Not clear that the shift click is only on a valid path, need more instructions
    * Like that you can do all three things at once
    * Add a level
    * Make clear you need to make a wave before a level
    * Units for spawn frequency
    * Dont let save without name
    * Dont let save duplicate levels
    * Making a projectile 
    * Popup do you want to override object with this name instead of not popping anything up; show error
* User 8 Feedback
    * Be more intuitive to type in the actual grid dimensions
    * Spawn point hard to figure out
    * Likes the design
    * Needs units
    * Frequency upgrade?
    * Intuitive design
    * Delete path?
    * Potentially buttons for spawn point
    * Text in the empty space as directions
    * Appreciated the selected image getting bigger after selected
    * Bigger map size slider range would be nice
* User 9 Feedback
    * Create game before load game, for chronological detail
    * Is full screen, curious about how the resolution might effect organizational structure
    * What does dropdown on map editor do
    * Can’t just click to add a path tile
    * Also wanted an undo, rather than a global delete
    * Wants to specify whether the defense name is something only seen in the authoring environment or if is the title
    * Frequency upgrade isn’t understood, doesn’t understand (+)
    * Added the projectile no problemo, saved the defense
    * Insert is an odd term for titles and what not
    * Didn’t understand what “wave 0” - “some info” was supposed to mean.
    * Tried to make a level, thought he needed to make an enemy first since he couldn’t interact with wave options
    * Then figured out he needed to add wave objects first
    * Unsure of select enemies, since no place to select enemies was presented
    * Issue saving map and attaching it to 
    * Why does save add new waves?
    * Save to xml shouldn’t be next to the game title, should be after tower health so people don’t do that first
    * Nothing to indicate a completed save, and save to xml doesn’t allow you to choose where to save the xml to.
* User 10 Feedback
    * Color dropdown menu should say that it changes the background color
    * For size, might be helpful to say 10x10 rather than 10
    * Bit confused at first as to how to add paths, figured out the drag, no clarity as to what happens in weird path cases
    * Figured out that erasing path happens through clicking
    * Maybe rename frequency to firing rate?
    * Understood frequency upgrade system
    * Needs units for speed, potentially a slider?
    * Need clarity on what health means for a projectile
    * Flow of everything is intuitive
* User 11 Feedback
    * Spawn point confusing/unintuitive
    * Friendly UI overall
    * Frequency upgrade? 
    * Enjoyed overall experience
* User 12 Feedback
    * Spawn point confusing, should have an option to create a spawn point.
    * Extreme projectile frequency allowed
    * Four directional arrows not enough for something like a turn
    * For spawning: click on a tile and a button for create spawn
    * Dragging thing would be nice to have an option to
    * Error check the projectile values like damage and health
    * Report those errors
    * Units!
    * Selecting projectile seems confusing
    * A scroll bar to limit extreme values?
    * Frequency upgrade clarification
